# pitchly-config-ui

This package contains Blaze configuration UI templates for Pitchly OAuth.

This package should only be installed if you wish to quickly prototype a login interface in your Meteor app with Pitchly using [accounts-ui](https://guide.meteor.com/accounts.html#accounts-ui). In most cases, creating a custom login interface is encouraged instead.

This package is intended to be installed alongside the [accounts-pitchly](https://github.com/Pitchlyapp/accounts-pitchly) package.
